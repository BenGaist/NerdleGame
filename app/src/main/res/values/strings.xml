About Nerdle\n
Nerdle is a daily math puzzle inspired by logic games and a love for numbers. Each day you’ll face a hidden equation to solve in six tries or less.\n\n

How to Play\n
1. Each guess must be a valid calculation.\n
2. Use numbers (0–9) and the symbols + - * / =.\n
3. Your guess must include exactly one “=”, with only a number on the right side (e.g., 3+4=7).\n
4. Standard math order applies (* and / before + and -).\n
5. Commutative answers are accepted (e.g., 10+20=30 and 20+10=30 both work).\n\n

Feedback Hints\n
• Green = correct symbol in the correct spot.\n
• Purple = correct symbol but in the wrong spot.\n
• Black = not in the solution.\n\n

Tips\n
• First guesses should use many different numbers and operators to gather information.\n
• Reposition purple tiles to test new spots.\n
• Try to place the "=" early to reduce possibilities.\n
• Use logic and deduction to narrow the solution quickly.\n\n

Goal\n
Turn all tiles green and solve the Nerdle! Come back tomorrow for a new challenge.
